# NC News Front End Project  ðŸ“°

Welcome to my NC News Front End Project!   

Here is a link to the hosted site: [Been There, News That!](https://been-there-news-that.netlify.app/)

Here is a link to the [hosted API](https://nc-news-0nn8.onrender.com/) and its respective [repo](https://github.com/deedee-2904/nc-news-BE.git)!  

This project fetches data from the hosted API and presents it in a clear, styled format for the user.

## Getting Started

You will need to clone the [repo](https://github.com/deedee-2904/nc-news-FE.git) to your local device.  Run the following commands in the terminal to do so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deedee-2904/nc-news-FE.git

cd nc-news-FE
```

Then you will need to install a number of dev dependant and non-dev dependant packages.

### Installing Packages

Run ```npm install``` or ```npm i``` to install the following packages on your local device:

Dev Dependancies:

- axios
- bootstrap
- react
- react-bootstrap
- react-dom
- react-router-dom
- lottie-react

Non-Dev Dependancies: 

- globals
- vite
- @vitejs/plugin-react
- @eslint/js
- @types/react
- @types/react-dom
- eslint
- eslint-plugin-react-hooks

For the best experience please ensure you are running the minimum versions of Node.js(v23.3.0).

To see the local changes made live, download the VSCode Extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

A link will then be provided to see local changes.
